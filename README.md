# klaudsol-cms
KlaudSol CMS is a Headless and Serverless CMS (Content Management System). Welcome to the future. üëΩüëæüõ∏

* A great headless and serverless alternative to WordPress and Strapi.
* Serverless - stop worrying about servers, uptime, devops, and deployment. 
  * Just keep coding - *it will just run*. üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
  * No more support calls on weekends and midnights.
  * Written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
* Headless - Have **absolute control** on how your site looks and feels. 
  * No more studying of new templating languages. 
  * No more kludgy "UI Builders" that don't do what you want them to do. 
  * Works great with a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend!
* Deploys seamlessly to [AWS Amplify Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) + [AWS Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/).
  * Have full access and control to **your** data.
* Licensed under a permissive licence ([MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).
